### ✨ Arch Linux quick Installation:
- A guide to install using the install script:[`Youtube Link`](https://youtu.be/BUgzNdxOaD4) 
- a.) You can install one by one packages above or choose the automatic installer script.

### ✨ NVIDIA-Hyprland notes:
- kindly note, on configs I added all the nvidia variables from Hyprland wiki [`Link`](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Nvidia/) but by default they are not enabled. I've had issues like OBS not recording, or intermittent crashing etc, on my laptop. Check the ~/.config/hypr/configs/exec.conf and uncomment one by one to try. You can read through Hyprland-Wiki for some guidance.
